      expression: `U(\\vec \\phi, \\alpha)`,
      explanation: "Suppose a potential energy function with some number of degrees of freedom, say N+1 representing orientations of interacting bodies all with the same interaction strength except the 0th has a strength of $&\\alpha&$. Also suppose that for all values of $&\\alpha&$ there is a stable equilibrium of U, denoted as $&\\vec \\phi^*(\\alpha)&$. Since it's a stable equilibrium you can linearize the equations of motion and get upto N+1 natural frequencies of oscillation $&\\omega_i&$ with corresponding perturbations from equilibrium $&\\delta \\vec \\phi_i&$, one for each degree of freedom with the exception of degeneracies."

    {
      expression: `\\partial_{\\alpha}\\vec \\phi^*(\\alpha) = \\Sigma_{k=0}^N c_k \\delta \\vec \\phi_k`,
      explanation: "Supposing the change in equilibrium is smooth with continuous variation in $&\\alpha&$ the quantity could be expressed as linear combination of the normal modes."
