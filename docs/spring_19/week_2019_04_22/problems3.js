    {
      expression: `-`,
      explanation: "In all cases of quark combinations there have been extra rules, I have no idea what special rules exist for allowed spin states. I'll simply assume there are none and that there are 4 different spin combinations, leading to 16 total combinations of iso-spin and spin configurations as they are independent properties and their configuration spaces can be multiplied together."
