    {
      expression: `-`,
      explanation: "as can be seen in the appendix, the orbit is quite circular, and inspection of the data in non_adaptive_keplerian_120steps.txt at the end of a year the particle is within 1 part in 10 million of it's starting point, as an AU is ~1.5E8 km that would mean it's within a hundred kilometers of it's starting point."
    },
    {
      expression: `-`,
      explanation: "using the adaptive rk4 with a spot tolerance of 1 part in a thousand the final position is identical out to 5 decimal places, however it was able to accomplish the process in 16*2 steps, so the plot looks rather polygonal."
    },
    {
      expression: `-`,
      explanation: "Plotting the step size as a function of radius you can see at very small radii close to the singularity the step size gets quite small. You can also observe a hysteresis effect coming from the stricter conditions on making step size smaller vs letting step size get bigger in this particular implementation."
