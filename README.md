# worked_problems
A place to put problems I've worked out for later reference

git add changed_file
  or
git add .
  then
git commit -m "description of changes"


lazy approach
git commit -am 'commit message'

  to save to remote (dangerous)
git push origin master
  more generally
git push remote_name branch_name
